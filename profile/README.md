# dHub - ETH Global Hackathon Entry

## What?

Event Management for Web3 Audience. Create Exclusive events for your token holders. 

## Why? 

Current web2 tools for events have support for emails and accounts using which you can grant and restrict access to particular events. We build a tool that is web3 native and helps events managers to make their content available exclusive to Token Holders. Token can be given out to wallet addresses before or during the event making the experience very smooth.
In the process we also use blockchain native solution for broadcasting, making it censorship resistant. 

## How?

We use livepeer for live streaming and moralis to fetch NFT Related data with respect to any address. dHub enables web3 native sharing of content with the community. 

## Use Cases:

* Event Organisers can sell exclusive access to livestream and recorded events to NFT communities. 
* People can host live parties for NFT Members
* Live announcement can be made to token holder by companies
* TV Channels that have web3 Native
* News Reporting for Web3 Community
* Live Auction and Bidding Platform

## Roadmap:
* Recorded Events
* Direct Broadcast from the platform (right now we depend on tools like OBS for starting the live stream)
* Social Interactions alongside the livestream - Like chats, games or collaboration tools.
* Smart Contract for Token Gating
